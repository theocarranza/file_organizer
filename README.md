# File Organizer Project
**A tool for organizing files, pretty self explanatory**
This script organizes files in a specified folder by type and moves duplicates.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* **Tkinter**: This project uses Tkinter for the folder selection GUI.
    On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, install it with:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    ```
    For other systems, please find the appropriate command to install Tkinter for Python 3.

## Setup

1.  Clone this repository or download the files.
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd file_organizer_project`
3.  Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4.  (If there were pip-installable dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Ensure the `python3-tk` package (or equivalent) is installed.
Activate the virtual environment, then run:
```bash
python file_organizer.py

>>>>>>> main
